Hi there 🌸, I’m Farah Yasser
✨ About Me

I’m a Backend Developer working with Laravel, with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I’m deeply passionate about learning, growth, and building meaningful systems that are clean, reliable, and thoughtfully designed.

I enjoy working on backend logic, APIs, and databases, while also appreciating the harmony between backend and frontend. I believe good software is not just functional — it’s calm, intentional, and well-structured.

🌱 Currently growing in: Advanced Laravel, REST APIs, Backend Architecture, Database Design

💼 Open to roles in Backend & Full-Stack Development

⚡ Little joy: turning ideas into systems that quietly work beautifully
